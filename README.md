A [dependency injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection)
implementation based on autowiring and
[PSR-11](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-11/) compatible dependency injection containers.

## Features

 * Injects dependencies when calling functions and creating objects
 * Works with any dependency injection container (DIC) that is [PSR-11](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-11/) compatible
 * Accepts additional dependencies and arguments passed as array
 * Allows to pass arguments *by parameter name* in the array
 * Resolves object type dependencies from the DIC and the passed array
   by [parameter type declaration](https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.arguments.php#functions.arguments.type-declaration)
 * Resolves [variadic arguments](https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.arguments.php#functions.variable-arg-list)
   i.e. `function (MyClass ...$a)`


## About

Injector can automatically resolve and inject dependencies when calling
functions and creating objects.

It therefore uses [Reflection](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.reflection.php) to analyze the
parameters of the function to call or the constructor of the class to
instantiate and then tries to resolve all arguments by several strategies.

The main purpose is to find dependency objects - that is arguments of type
object that are declared with a classname or an interface - in a (mandatory)
[PSR-11](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-11/) compatible *dependency injection
container* (DIC). The container must therefore use the class or interface name
as Id.

In addition an array with arguments can be passed that will also be scanned for
matching dependencies. To make things really flexible (and not limited to
objects), arguments in that array can optionally use a function parameter name
as key. This way basically any callable can be invoked and any object
be instantiated by the Injector even if it uses a mix of object dependencies and
arguments of other types.


## Basic Example

```php
// A function to call
$fn = function (\App\Foo $a, \App\Bar $b, int $c) { /* ... */ };

// Arbitrary PSR-11 compatible object container
$container = new \some\di\Container([
    'App\Foo' => new Foo(), // will be used as $a
]);

// Prepare the injector
$injector = new Injector($container);

// Use the injector to call the function and resolve dependencies
$result = $injector->invoke($fn, [
    'c' => 15,  // will be used as $c
    new Bar(),  // will be used as $b
]);
```
